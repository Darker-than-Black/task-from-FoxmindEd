==Description==

Bootstrap v.4 basic theme. For build new theme based on Bootstrap 4.
The concept is to keep it basic, no rich features, no additional functions; all of these for theme developers will be easier to start develop their theme.
If the theme contain too many options, some of those options maybe no need by the others it will be waste of time to find and remove.
It is still keep the same concept as Bootstrap Basic (version 1) which is minimal, just basic, easy to start build your own theme whether it is for new parent theme or child theme.

To make Bootstrap 4 work in older Internet Explorer (IE) please create child theme and use this css ( https://github.com/coliff/bootstrap-ie8 ) created by @Coliff.
